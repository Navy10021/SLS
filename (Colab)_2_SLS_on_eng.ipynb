Surprisingly, we find\n","that grid-like spatial response patterns emerge in trained networks, along with\n","units that exhibit other spatial correlates, including border cells and\n","band-like cells. All these different functional types of neurons have been\n","observed experimentally. The order of the emergence of grid-like and border\n","cells is also consistent with observations from developmental studies.\n","Together, our results suggest that grid cells, border cells and others as\n","observed in EC may be a natural solution for representing space efficiently\n","given the predominant recurrent connections in the neural circuits.\n","\n","\n"," >> Top 10 - Paper Title : Network neuroscience for optimizing brain-computer interfaces  \n"," | Cluster : -1 \n"," | Extracted keywords : problem, algorithm, paper, results, using, study, method, used, time, approach, based, analysis, systems, new, use, proposed, different, function, set, present \n"," | Year : 2019 \n"," | Abstract :   Human-machine interactions are being increasingly explored to create\n","alternative ways of communication and to improve our daily life. Based on a\n","classification of the user's intention from the user's underlying neural\n","activity, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct interactions with the\n","external environment while bypassing the traditional effector of the\n","musculoskeletal system. Despite the enormous potential of BCIs, there are still\n","a number of challenges that limit their societal impact, ranging from the\n","correct decoding of a human's thoughts, to the application of effective\n","learning strategies. Despite several important engineering advances, the basic\n","neuroscience behind these challenges remains poorly explored. Indeed, BCIs\n","involve complex dynamic changes related to neural plasticity at a diverse range\n","of spatiotemporal scales. One promising antidote to this complexity lies in\n","network science, which provides a natural language in which to model the\n","organizational principles of brain architecture and function as manifest in its\n","interconnectivity. Here, we briefly review the main limitations currently\n","affecting BCIs, and we offer our perspective on how they can be addressed by\n","means of network theoretic approaches. We posit that the emerging field of\n","network neuroscience will prove to be an effective tool to unlock human-machine\n","interactions.\n","\n"]}],"source":["# 3.
